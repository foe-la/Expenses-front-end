## Challenges During this Project

Being relatively new to coding, I had challanges with getting my backend to connect to my frontend. I also faced difficulty with debugging the routes for my buttons.

All in all I enjoyed the problem solving of working with my application and I want to explore creating more complex models.

I built my frontend application with React, which you can view here. https://github.com/foe-la/Expenses-front-end.git

## Future Plans for Expense Tracker App:

I wanted to add charts to show the trends in the users spending and to be able to add user authentication so it would give a layer of privacy pertaining to expenses.
